With both console and graphical interfaces, this Currency Converter application is made to give users access to real-time currency exchange rate conversions. The app allows users to convert between currencies in a matter of seconds and retrieves the most recent exchange rates via a third-party exchange rate API. The project consists of:

For speedy and effective text-based conversions, use a console-based interface.
With features like dropdown menus, a tabbed interface, and real-time feedback, this Java Swing-based GUI provides a more engaging experience.
The GUI will have more tabs for showing statistics and trends, and visual charts and drag-and-drop functionality will be added for a more interesting user experience.
